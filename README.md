Angell Class Monitor
--------------------

This is an unofficial script to track and make available the [pet training classes](https://www.mspca.org/animal_care/boston-dog-training/) offered by the Boston MSPCA Angell center.

Currently it runs at [angell.kdf.sh](http://angell.kdf.sh) showing current classes; hopefully soon it will be able to e-mail alerts as well when classes are updated.
